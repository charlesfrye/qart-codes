# TODOs

## Frontend
- Cancel button
- More parameters: "Negative Prompt" and two sliders: "QR code < -- > Art" "Quick & Dirty < -- > Slow & Purdy"
- Show a gallery of examples while people are waiting?
- Randomly choose a prompt from a set of nice ones
- Randomly choose QR text between the short link, the GitHub repo, Rickroll, etc
- Prompt (and negative prompt) should be short-form/textbox, QR code can stay single-line
- Toast to warn users who enter long QR codes (>25 characters) that it's not likely to work
- Allow downloading mixed QR/QaRt codes, based on slider
- "Verify scan" button

## Backend
- prepare to allow more config params from users
- run a sweep over hyperparameters to pick good defaults
- find a way to change the start/stop time, as in the WebUI
- deliver the results directly from the stub

## Skunkworks
- write a natural language interface
